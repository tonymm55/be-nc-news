### Environment Variables

Create two `.env` files in the project root folder: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Add the following line to each file, replacing "your_database_name" with the correct database name:

PGDATABASE=your_database_name

Ensure that these files are added to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing sensitive and private information.
